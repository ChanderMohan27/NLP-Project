# Job Advertisement Classification System using NLP

## Overview
This project aims to automate the classification of job advertisements using NLP techniques. The system preprocesses job ad text, generates feature representations, and applies machine learning models to predict job categories. The Data of Job advertisement stored in multiple files and folder so we need to create a pipeline to preprocess the data and automate the machine learning steps. The second part of the project to development of a job hunting website using the Python Flask web development framework. This website allows job hunters to browse job advertisements and enables employers to create new job listings. The site incorporates a machine learning model from the first milestone to auto-classify job advertisement categories, enhancing user experience and reducing data entry errors.


## Learning Outcomes
- Preprocess natural language text data for feature generation.
- Document the data preprocessing pipeline for transparency and reproducibility.

## Tasks
- **Task 1:** Basic text preprocessing to clean job ad descriptions.
- **Task 2:** Generating feature representations using bag-of-words and word embeddings.
- **Task 3:** Building and evaluating machine learning models for job ad classification.


## Features of Web Application

- View all available job advertisements.
- Browse job ads by category.
- Access full descriptions of job ads from previews. 
- Receive automatic category recommendations for new job listings


## Outputs
- Preprocessed text files.
- Count vector and word embedding representations.
- Jupyter notebooks for tasks and analysis.
